    <title>Python Learning Roadmap: Automation & Data Science</title>
    <!-- Chosen Palette: Deep Night Bloom -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application is a single-page, vertically scrolling experience designed with a dark, modern aesthetic inspired by the provided image. It features a prominent header, followed by distinct "Phase" sections. Within each phase, "Week Cards" are arranged in a responsive grid, mirroring the card-based content presentation from the inspiration image. Each Week Card is interactive: clicking it expands a collapsible area to reveal detailed learning topics, video focus, and a project idea. This expanded area also includes a "Mark as Complete" checkbox (visually updating the card) and a "Get New Project Idea" button powered by the Gemini API. This structure prioritizes visual appeal, intuitive navigation, and on-demand information access, breaking down a complex roadmap into manageable, engaging, and interactive components. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        - Roadmap Structure -> Goal: Organize & Inform -> Viz/Presentation Method: Responsive grid of "week cards" within thematic "phase sections." Each card has a title, icon, and a collapsible detail area. -> Interaction: Click on a week card to toggle the visibility of its detailed content. -> Justification: Mimics the clean, card-based layout of the inspiration image, making the roadmap visually appealing and easy to scan. Collapsible details prevent information overload. -> Library/Method: Pure HTML (semantic elements), Tailwind CSS (grid, flexbox, spacing, colors, shadows, rounded corners), Vanilla JavaScript for toggle functionality.
        - Progress Tracking -> Goal: Engage & Inform (simple feedback). -> Viz/Presentation Method: Checkbox within each week's detail area. When checked, the week card's title will be styled (e.g., strikethrough, subtle color change) to indicate completion. -> Interaction: User clicks the checkbox. -> Justification: Provides direct, immediate visual feedback on completion without needing a separate progress bar, keeping the design streamlined. -> Library/Method: HTML checkbox, Tailwind CSS for conditional styling (via JS class toggling), Vanilla JavaScript for state management (localStorage).
        - Project Idea Generator (LLM Integration) -> Goal: Engage & Support. -> Viz/Presentation Method: Text output within the week's detail area, updated dynamically. -> Interaction: Button click initiates LLM call to generate a new project idea. Includes a loading spinner. -> Justification: Provides on-demand, personalized learning support, directly integrating a powerful AI feature into the learning experience. -> Library/Method: HTML button, Tailwind CSS for button styling and spinner, Vanilla JavaScript for API call and DOM updates, Gemini API (gemini-2.0-flash).
        - Icons/Visuals -> Goal: Inform & Engage. -> Viz/Presentation Method: Unicode Emojis for week icons. -> Interaction: None. -> Justification: Lightweight, scalable, and visually appealing, consistent with modern web design without external image dependencies. -> Library/Method: Direct Unicode characters in HTML.
